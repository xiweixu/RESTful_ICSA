	abstract="Metadata is a key component of the REST architecture that can be used to provide additional information about web resources. The ultimate goal of metadata is to transform web resources into self describing information units that can be automatically processed by software agents. We review the main options present in the HTTP standard to provide metadata for web resources. We also review the main mechanisms proposed by standard organizations like the W3C and the IETF as well as by groups of practitioners to provide additional ways of associating metadata to resources. The connection between metadata and semantic web technologies is also explored. Finally the notion of resource and metadata discovery is also introduced and the main discovery technologies are reviewed.",

	abstract="This chapter discusses the significance of domain application protocols in distributed application design and development. Describing an application as an instance of the execution of a domain application protocol, it shows how we can design RESTful APIs that allow clients to drive the execution of a domain application protocol without binding to the protocol itself. The second half of the chapter provides a step-by-step example of a RESTful procurement application; this application realizes a procurement protocol in a way that requires clients to couple simply to media types and link relations, rather than to the protocol.",
